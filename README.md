  ## Test
  **One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:**
  * Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

  * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.
